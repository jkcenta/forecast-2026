  // quotes is one paragraph, followed by a comma. Two or three short paragraphs:
  // what your forecast is built from, how you set the national environment,
  // and how you handled uncertainty. Until you fill this in, your site shows a
  // reminder in this spot.
  //
  // For example, the class model could be described like this (describe your
  // own model):
  //   "A fundamentals-only model (no polls). Each race's predicted Democratic share combines the district's partisan lean, incumbency, and a forecast of the national House vote from presidential approval, gas prices, income and the midterm penalty.",
  //   "Uncertainty combines one national error shared by every race with a separate error for each race. Seat totals come from 10,000 simulated elections.",
  method: [
  "Each race starts from the district's partisan lean (PVI), the national Democratic vote, and incumbency. Where a district's lines haven't changed since 2024, I also use last election's House result in that district.",
  "My national House vote is 53.5% Democratic. It averages my model of presidential approval, midterm status and the previous House vote (54.2%) with the generic-ballot polls, corrected for how Democratic they have been in the past (53.0%). The polls get about 65% of the weight because they have missed by less.",
  "Uncertainty combines one national error shared by every race with a separate error for each race. Seat totals come from 10,000 simulations."
